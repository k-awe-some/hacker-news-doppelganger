# HackerNews Doppelganger

[HackerNews Doppelganger](https://hackernews-doppelganger.herokuapp.com/) is a (soft) [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) clone that uses the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) to display data available in near real time.

## Description

The current version of this web app fetches New, Top and Best Stories along with information of the users and comments. Future improvements will be made, which will hopefully get the most out of the API's abilities to deliver other live data (including but not limited to Ask, Show and Job Stories).

A night mode is also implemented for readability purposes, which can be toggled by clicking the top right corner ðŸ’¡ icon.

## Technologies

This app is created with:

- React.js version 16.9.0
